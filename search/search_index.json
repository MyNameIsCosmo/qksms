If you have any suggestions on how we can improve our workflow, please feel free to contact me.\n\n\nQuite a bit of old code still needs to be cleaned up and refactored, so keep that in mind as you're digging through the source. If you find something that's just really crappy, let me know and I'll put it higher up on my list of stuff to clean up. I'll be focusing on improving code quality of existing code over the next couple weeks.\n\n\nCollaboration\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe use GitHub issues to keep track of bugs and feature requests, but we communicate using \nSlack\n. To join the Slack group, send an email to \nteam@qklabs.com\n with the subject \nQK Labs Slack Invite\n (no need to enter a body, we'll send an invite to your email address). If you plan on contributing at some point, we highly recommend joining the slack group because it gives you a direct way to communicate with the rest of the contributors.\n\n\nFunds\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help support the project, you can donate via \nPayPal here\n.\n\n\nTranslations\n\u00b6\n\n\nPlease do not perform translations directly on the source files. Pull requests for translations will not be accepted. If you would like to do translations for QKSMS, join the translation project on Crowdin: \nhttps://crowdin.com/project/qksms\n.\n\n\nUnfortunately I don't always have time to check notifications on Crowdin. If you'd like something checked or approved, send me a message on Slack and then I'll take a look\n\n\nDevelopment\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe encourage you to make pull requests. Whenever you make one, we'll review the code and test it to make sure that it fits the code style guidelines, and achieves what the pull request intends. We'll discuss any problems or potential improvements, and we'll merge it when we're both (or any number of willing participants) happy with the code.\n\n\nIf you're new, we recommend that you look through the issues and try to fix some of the more simple sounding bugs to familiarize yourself with the codebase.\n\n\nIf you'd like to work on a new feature, please create an issue so we can discuss the idea together before implementation begins.\n\n\nTo learn about pull requests, please refer to the following guide: \nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\n.\n\n\nCode style\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe follow the code style guidelines set by Google for contributors to AOSP: \nhttps://source.android.com/source/code-style.html\n\n\nThe current codebase is far from being 100% at this standard, but updating existing code to follow the unified guidelines can be a good way to introduce yourself to the codebase and start getting familiar with it.\n\n\nAny new code written should follow these guidelines.\n\n\nBug Reports / Feature Requests\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe track issues and feature requests using GitHub issues.

We need to know what we're looking for and where to look for it. If the QKSMS team can't reproduce a bug, we will work with testers to fix the problem.\n\n\nBugs are given the red \nbug\n label. Bugs also may be given extra orange labels:\n\n\nneeds-info\n: We need a better description of the problem.\n\nneeds-repro\n: We need someone who can reproduce the issue consistently.\n\nneeds-review\n: We need someone to verify that the bug has been squashed.\n\n\nExample bug report submission\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nThis is a real bug as of the time of writing. Try reproducing it!\n\n\n\n\n### DESCRIPTION\nConversations aren't marked as read when they are opened from a notification.\n\n### STEPS\n1. Long press on a conversation and press \"Mark as unread\" to reveal a notification.\n2. Press the home button to put QKSMS in the background.\n3. Pull down on the notification to open the notification drawer.\n4. Tap on the body of the notification (not the buttons).\n5. Tap on the back button to reveal the conversation list.\n\n### EXPECTED\nThe conversation is marked as read.\n\n### OBSERVATIONS\nThe conversation isn't marked as read.\n\n\n\n\nHelping reproduce bugs\n\u00b6\n\n\nReproducing a bug is important, since if we can't reproduce an issue then it's hard to figure out what's going wrong, and we can't know that we've fixed it.\n\n\nYou can see bugs which need \"repro steps\" \nhere\n.
